# CROP RECOMMENDATION PROJECT - USING MACHINE LEARNING 

**Objective: Create an agronomic recommendation model using Machine Learning Algorithms such as basic Decision tree classifier and KNN Algorithm**

**Explanation:**

These models provide a recommended crop type based on soil and climate conditions. We could expand the dataset for more accurate predictions, or use more complex models as data volume and complexity increase.

**Possible Improvements:**

**Additional Features:** Include factors like rainfall, soil nutrient levels, and sunlight.

**Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize model parameters to improve accuracy.

**Model Selection:** Experiment with other models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting for more robust recommendations.
