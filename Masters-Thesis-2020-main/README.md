**Fake Profile Detection Using Supervised Machine Learning Project**

Masterâ€™s Thesis on a structured dataset of Twitter user profiles to determine a user profile whether fake or not.

Using compare and contrast methodology for identifying the best performing models to solve binary classification problems using supervised machine learning algorithms such as SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, KNN, Random Forest Classifier and XGBoost.

**Objective**

To identify the above-discussed concerns there has to be a system in place to determine what is the factor which can help us distinguish between fake and real profiles in order to make social networking more secure and trustworthy. This research would also highlight the framework of the fake account characteristics which are created by bots to understand their mechanism. Determination of deceptive user profiles has been a major problem with a lot of researchers when it comes to Online Social Networks (OSN) and this is a major growing concern which allows the need to efficiently research the user profile details with the application of machine learning algorithms. Therefore the objective of this research be aimed
towards classifying the user profile account on the basis of fake or real.

**Research Question**

Based on the above objectives the questions we would be solving in this research study provide a comprehensive approach towards 

1. What determines whether the particular user profile is fake or not or whether it would require further investigation based on their profile features?
2. With the help of a comparison of several machine learning algorithms I attempt to determine which of these algorithms provides the best result based on accuracy and precision scores
3. I would also like to determine if there are any other features which could be taken into consideration to make the research more contributing towards solving the problems.
4. Based on the results of the above algorithms could these approaches also be implemented by start-ups who are running a similar social networking principle?
