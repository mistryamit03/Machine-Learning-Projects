## üìå Project Summary

This project tackles the challenge of forecasting demand and optimizing product prices in a retail e-commerce environment. Using a combination of time-series forecasting (ARIMA), gradient boosting (XGBoost), and feedforward neural networks (MLP), the solution identifies pricing strategies that maximize profit and revenue across different product categories.

## üßë‚Äçüíª How to Use

1. Load the dataset into a DataFrame.
2. Run the EDA notebook to explore trends.
3. Apply feature engineering to generate demand, profit, and price-related fields.
4. Forecast demand using ARIMA and XGBoost.
5. Optimise prices using a custom MLP model.
6. Simulate revenue using adjusted prices.

## üì¶ Data Overview

Your dataset should include the following features, grouped and described below:

---

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `product_id` | Unique identifier for each product |
| `product_category_name` | Category the product belongs to |
| `product_name_lenght` | Length of product name (used as a proxy for descriptiveness) |
| `product_description_lenght` | Length of product description text |
| `product_photos_qty` | Number of photos associated with the product |
| `product_weight_g` | Weight of the product in grams |
| `product_score` | Average customer rating score (usually 1‚Äì5) |

| `weekday` | Day of the week (0 = Monday, 6 = Sunday) |
| `weekend` | Boolean flag indicating if the sale happened on weekend |
| `holiday` | Boolean flag for public holidays |

---

### üì¶ Transaction Data
| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|

---

### üë• Customer Information
| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `customers` | Number of unique customers involved in the sale |

---

### üè∑Ô∏è Lag and Trend Features
| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `lag_price` | Previous period's unit price (used to analyze price trends) |
| `price_change` | Difference in unit price from the last period |

---

---

This feature setup is ideal for building predictive models around demand, price sensitivity, revenue optimisation, and competitor benchmarking. Each column provides rich insights into customer behaviour, pricing dynamics, and profitability.

These features are used for modelling elasticity, computing profits, and benchmarking competitors.

üîÆ Forecasting Product Demand
We apply both classical and ML-based forecasting techniques:

ARIMA: Applied per category after stationarity checks to model seasonality and trends.

XGBoost: Handles non-linear demand patterns.

Evaluation metrics: RMSE, MAE, and R¬≤.

üí∏ Optimising Prices
A custom-built Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is used to optimise product pricing (unit and total price).

üìê Architecture Summary
Layer	Details
Input Layer	: All selected numerical features
Hidden Layer 1	64 neurons + ReLU + Dropout(0.2)
Hidden Layer 2	32 neurons + ReLU + Dropout(0.2)
Hidden Layer 3	16 neurons + ReLU
Output Layer	1 neuron (predicts price)
Loss Function	MSE (regression task)
Optimizer	Adam

The model captures key drivers of pricing such as:

Freight cost

Product score

Competition prices

Demand fluctuations

üìä Projecting Revenue
Once optimised prices are obtained, revenue can be simulated using expected quantities.

Example Simulation
Category	Optimised Price	Expected Quantity	Simulated Revenue
perfumery	412.29	159	65,553.61
watches_gifts	1689.66	753	1,272,317.31

‚úÖ Evaluating Model Performance
Models are evaluated using:

R¬≤ Score ‚Äì Goodness of fit

RMSE ‚Äì Error magnitude

MAE ‚Äì Absolute error

Separate metrics are generated per category and model (ARIMA/XGBoost/MLP).
