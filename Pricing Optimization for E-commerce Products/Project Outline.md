## üìå Project Summary

This project tackles the challenge of forecasting demand and optimizing product prices in a retail e-commerce environment. Using a combination of time-series forecasting (ARIMA), gradient boosting (XGBoost), and feedforward neural networks (MLP), the solution identifies pricing strategies that maximize profit and revenue across different product categories.

## üßë‚Äçüíª How to Use

1. Load the dataset into a DataFrame.
2. Run the EDA notebook to explore trends.
3. Apply feature engineering to generate demand, profit, and price-related fields.
4. Forecast demand using ARIMA and XGBoost.
5. Optimise prices using a custom MLP model.
6. Simulate revenue using adjusted prices.

| `weekend` | Boolean flag indicating if the sale happened on a weekend |
| `holiday` | Boolean flag for public holidays |

---

### üì¶ Transaction Data
| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `qty` | Quantity of products sold |
| `unit_price` | Price per unit paid by the customer |
| `freight_price` | Shipping fee charged to the customer |
| `total_price` | Final billed amount including product and freight |
| `volume` | Approximate product volume (could be derived from dimensions or weight) |

---

### üë• Customer Information
| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `customers` | Number of unique customers involved in the sale |

---

### üè∑Ô∏è Lag and Trend Features
| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `lag_price` | Previous period's unit price (used to analyze price trends) |
| `price_change` | Difference in unit price from the last period |

---

### ü§ñ Competitive Benchmarking
| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `comp_1`, `comp_2`, `comp_3` | Competitor names or IDs |
| `ps1`, `ps2`, `ps3` | Prices from competitors (ps = price sold by competitor) |
| `fp1`, `fp2`, `fp3` | Freight prices from competitors |

---

### üìà Demand & Profit Metrics
| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `demand` | Estimated or calculated demand using a linear or ML-based function |
| `revenue_our_product` | Revenue generated by our product |
| `profit_our_product` | Profit after cost and shipping deductions |
| `margin_our_product` | Profit margin of our product (profit / revenue) |
| `revenue_comp1`, `revenue_comp2`, `revenue_comp3` | Estimated revenue for each competitor |
| `profit_comp1`, `profit_comp2`, `profit_comp3` | Estimated profit for each competitor |
| `margin_comp1`, `margin_comp2`, `margin_comp3` | Estimated profit margin for each competitor |

---

### üîç Price Comparison Features
| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `fp1_diff`, `fp2_diff`, `fp3_diff` | Difference between our freight price and competitors‚Äô |
| `price_ratio_1`, `price_ratio_2`, `price_ratio_3` | Ratio of our unit price to competitors‚Äô unit price |
| `price_diff_1`, `price_diff_2`, `price_diff_3` | Absolute difference in unit price from each competitor |

---

This feature setup is ideal for building predictive models around demand, price sensitivity, revenue optimisation, and competitor benchmarking. Each column provides rich insights into customer behaviour, pricing dynamics, and profitability.

## üîÆ Demand Forecasting

This project uses a hybrid approach combining classical and machine learning methods:

- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**: Applied per product category after verifying time series stationarity. Helps capture seasonality and trend behavior.
- **XGBoost**: A gradient boosting method used to handle non-linear relationships in demand forecasting.

**üìè Evaluation Metrics** used for demand models:
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- R¬≤ Score (Explained Variance)

## üí∏ Price Optimisation using Neural Networks

A **custom Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** is implemented to optimise pricing decisions (unit and total price) based on multiple factors like freight cost, competition, and demand.

### üß† Neural Network Architecture

| Layer Type     | Configuration                            |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Input Layer    | All selected numeric features             |
| Hidden Layer 1 | 64 neurons + ReLU + Dropout (rate: 0.2)   |
| Hidden Layer 2 | 32 neurons + ReLU + Dropout (rate: 0.2)   |
| Hidden Layer 3 | 16 neurons + ReLU                         |
| Output Layer   | 1 neuron (regression output)              |

- **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- **Optimizer**: Adam

üîç The model captures key drivers of pricing:
- Freight costs  
- Product ratings (score)  
- Competitor pricing  
- Demand elasticity and fluctuations

## üìä Revenue Projection

After optimised prices are obtained, we simulate revenue outcomes by applying expected sales volumes.

### üßÆ Example Simulation Table

| Product Category | Optimized Price | Expected Quantity | Simulated Revenue |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| `perfumery`      | 412.29           | 159               | 65,553.61         |
| `watches_gifts`  | 1689.66          | 753               | 1,272,317.31      |

## ‚úÖ Model Performance Evaluation

We evaluate each forecasting and pricing model using:

- **R¬≤ Score** ‚Äì Measures how well predictions match observed values  
- **RMSE** ‚Äì Shows how large the errors are in the same units as the target  
- **MAE** ‚Äì Gives the average magnitude of errors without penalising large deviations

Each model (ARIMA, XGBoost, and MLP) is evaluated per product category separately.
